    <span class="header-section">Using Saved Searches</span>
    <div class="section">
      In all of the control panel search interfaces you will have the ability to create and use saved searches.  A saved search allows you to store the exact
      search settings you used for a search so it can be quickly restored in the future.  This is handy if you do a lot of repeated searches and don't want to
      enter all of the search information each time you do the search.  The Saved Searches interface is accessed through the toolbar at the bottom of the page
      and looks like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-saved-searches.png" title="Saved Searches" />
      </div>

      <br />

      <ul>
        <b>Create New -</b> <span>Use this section to create a new Saved Search.

                            <br /><br />

                            <div class="message-notice">Saved searches can also be used to control the default search settings that are used each time you access
                            a search interface in the control panel.  Simply create a Saved Search with the identifier "Default" (no quotes) and that Saved Search
                            will be used every time you access that search interface!</div>

                            <br />

                            <img src="../images/save-22x22.png" />
                            <span>In the text input box, enter a short identifier that will help you to remember the search settings for this Saved Search.  You can then click this icon
                            to save the search settings with that identifier.

                            <br /><br />

                            Each type of item has it's own set of Saved Searches, so you can use the same identifier for each item type!
                            </span></span><br />

        <b>Load/Modify Existing -</b> <span>Use this section to work with your existing Saved Searches.

                                      <br /><br />

                                      <span>From the drop down selection list, choose the saved search that you would like to load, then click this icon to restore
                                      the settings for that saved search.  This will automatically trigger a new search based on the seach settings, and the matching
                                      items will be displayed.</span><br />

                                      <span>Use this icon to update an existing saved search.  If you have made some changes to the search parameters but want to save
                                      the search settings with the same identifier, you can use this icon.  Select the saved search that you want to overwrite, then click
                                      this icon to save the current search settings for the selected identifier.</span><br />

                                      saved search.  This will permanently delete the saved search.</span>
