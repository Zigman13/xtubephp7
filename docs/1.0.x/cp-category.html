    <div class="section">
      Managing categories is done by accessing the Categories &gt; Search Categories function in the control panel menu.
      From this interface you can add new categories and search, edit, or delete the existing categories.  For an overview of searching,
      adding, editing, and deleting items, please see the <a href="cp-basics.html">Control Panel Basics</a> section of this software manual.

    <span class="header-section">Database Fields</span>
    <div class="section">
      Categories have the following fields associated with them:

      <ul>
        <b>Name -</b> <span>The category's name.  Each category must have a unique name.</span><br />

        <b>URL Name -</b> <span>The value to use in mod_rewrite URLs for this category.  The URL name can contain English letters, numbers, underscores (_), and dashes (-).
                          Each category must have a unique URL name.</span><br />

        <b>Description -</b> <span>The category's description</span><br />

        <b>Meta Description -</b> <span>The category's description as it should appear in a meta tag</span><br />

        <b>Meta Keywords -</b> <span>The category's keywords as they should appear in a meta tag</span><br />

        <b>Auto Category Term -</b> <span>A comma separated list of keywords that should be used for automatic categorization (see below)</span>
      </ul>

    <a name="automatic-categorization" class="header-section">Automatic Categorization</a>
    <div class="section">
      Often when videos are imported (from XML feeds, YouTube, text files, etc) the import data will not include a category.  It is also possible that a category will be
      included in the import data but it will not match one of the categories you have setup.  In this case, TubeX uses the <i class="bold">Auto Category Term</i> to try to
      automatically categorize the videos for you.

      <br /><br />

      For each category that you create you should specify an Auto Category Term.  This will be a comma separated list of keywords that will be matched against the video
      title and description to generate a score.  For example, assume you have a category named <i class="bold">Comedy</i>.  You might use something like this for the Auto Category Term:

      <xmp style="margin-left: 20px;">comedy,funny,humor,laugh,joke,hilarious</xmp>

      When a video is imported, TubeX will compare the video title and description with this string of keywords.  Scoring is based on the number of matches: the more matches there are, the
      higher the score will be.  The category with the highest score will be selected as the category for the video.

      <br /><br />

      Matching is case-insensitive and it will match sub-strings.  So, for example, if the video title contained the word <i class="bold">humorous</i> this would match the example
      because it contains <i class="bold">humor</i>.
