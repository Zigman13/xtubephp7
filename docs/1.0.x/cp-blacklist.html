      Managing blacklist items is done by accessing the Settings &gt; Blacklist &gt; Search Blacklist Items function in the control panel menu.
      From this interface you can add new blacklist items and search, edit, or delete the existing blacklist items.  For an overview of searching,
      adding, editing, and deleting items, please see the <a href="cp-basics.html">Control Panel Basics</a> section of this software manual.

                      </span><br />

        <b>Regular expression -</b> <span>
                                      Check this box if the value is a regular expression.  Regular expressions are more complex than standard searches that simply look
                                      for the item as-is, but they add a great amount of flexibility.  In TubeX the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions format is used for regular expressions.  If you are not familiar
                                      with regular expressions, please see the <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php">Pattern Syntax portion of the PHP manual</a> for additional
                                      information.  If you check the Regular Expression box on the blacklist add/edit form, the item(s) you enter will be treated as regular expressions and used to match against the
                                      values that are submitted by the user.

                                      <br /><br />

                                      If the values you enter are not regular expressions, be sure to leave that box unchecked.  This will cause a normal search to occur which will match the item you enter anywhere within
                                      the field that is being searched.  For example, if you enter the word "car" as a blacklisted word and someone submits a description of "Carpool to work to save gas", this will match the
                                      "car" blacklist word item since it appears in the description.  Note that the search is case-insensitive and will match not only exact words, but also portions of words.
                                    </span><br />

        <b>Value -</b> <span>The value you want to add to the blacklist.</span><br />

        <b>Reason -</b> <span>Enter a reason why you are blacklisting this item, if you wish.  This will help you keep track of why a specific item has been blacklisted.</span><br />
