    <span class="header-section">Template Editing Interface</span>
    <div class="section">
      Editing the site templates is done through the Templates &gt; Site Templates function in the control panel.  That interface will look
      something like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-templates-site.png" title="Site Templates" />
      </div>

      <ul>
        <b>Available Templates -</b> <span>This section will list all of the available site templates that you can edit.  When you first access
                                     the page, only this section will be shown.  Click on a template name to load that template for editing.</span><br />

        <b>Code Editor -</b> <span>This is the text input box where you can make modifications to the template code.  When you first access this interface,
                             this field will not be visisble.  Click on one of the available templates to load that template and make the code editor visible.</span><br />

        <b>Toolbar Functions -</b> <span>Use the toolbar functions to peform the following actions:

    <span class="header-section">Search and Replace</span>
    <div class="section">
      TubeX allows you to make quick changes to your templates in bulk with the Search and Replace function.  When you access the Search and Replace function a dialog will appear that will allow you
      to select the templates that you want to perform this action on, the code to search for in the template, and the replacement code to use.  Multiple templates can be selected by holding down the shift or ctrl
      keys on your keyboard as you click on templates in the selection list.  Once you have selected the templates and entered the search and replacement code, press the Apply Changes button to start the task.
      Once completed a notification message will be displayed letting you know how many replacements were made.
    </div>


    <span class="header-section">Custom Templates</span>
    <div class="section">
      In addition to the default templates shipped with the software, it is also possible to create custom templates that you can use to display any information that you like.  The software ships with an example
      custom template named custom-rss-feed-newest.tpl which generates an RSS feed of the most recently added videos.  Custom templates can be used for any purpose that you like.

      <br /><br />

      <div class="bold large">Naming</div>
      Custom templates will need to be named using the following format:

      <ul class="mono">custom-TEMPLATE_NAME.tpl</ul>

      Where TEMPLATE_NAME is the unique name you want to use for the template.  The template filenames may contain only English letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.  So, for example, if you wanted to
      create a custom template to generate an RSS feed of the top rated videos you might use this for the filename:

      <ul class="mono">custom-rss-feed-top-rated.tpl</ul>


      <div class="bold large">Creating</div>
      Once you have determined the filename you want to use for the custom template, you can simply create an empty file with that name and upload it to the directory containing the template set you have selected.
      For example, if you are using the Default-Blue-Rewrite template set, you would upload the custom template file to the templates/Default-Blue-Rewrite directory of your TubeX installation.  Once the file is uploaded,
      set it's permissions to 666 which will allow you to edit that file through the control panel interface.

      <br /><br />

      <div class="bold large">Viewing</div>
      Now that the custom template file has been created, you will need to setup the HTML and template code.  This can be done just like you were editing any other template file.  Before you can view the output from
      the template it will be necessary to load and save the template so it can be processed and compiled for use by the software.

      <br /><br />

      The custom.php script is responsible for displaying the custom template pages, and accepts the <b><i>t=</i></b> parameter as the template name.  To view the example custom template custom-rss-feed-newest.tpl you
      would use this URL format:

      <ul class="mono">http://www.yoursite.com/tubex/custom.php?t=rss-feed-newest</ul>

      <div class="message-notice">Note that you only include the unique portion of the template filename (rss-feed-newest) and not the entire filename for the <b><i>t=</i></b> parameter.</div>

      <br />

      It is also possible to use mod_rewrite rules to create search-engine friendly URLs for your custom templates.  The default .htaccess file included with the software gives an example of how this can be done
      for the custom-rss-feed-newest.tpl custom template:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="code">RewriteRule ^feeds/newest/?([0-9]+)?/?$ custom.php?t=rss-feed-newest&p=$2 [L]</div>

      <br />

      You can add as many mod_rewrite rules to the .htaccess file as you need!
    </div>


    <span class="header-section">Templates &amp; Their Variables</span>
    <div class="section">
      All of the site templates will have the following two variables set:

      <ul>
        <b>$g_logged_in -</b> <span class="nmb">This will be true if the user viewing the page is an authenticated user, or false otherwise</span><br />
        <b>$g_config -</b> <span class="nmb">The software settings (see <a href="templates-common.html#g_config" target="_blank">Common Template Variables</a>)</span><br />
