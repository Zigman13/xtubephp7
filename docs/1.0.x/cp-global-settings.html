      <ul>

      <b>File Extensions -</b> <span>A comma separated list of file extensions that should be considered video files</span><br />

      <b>Video Format -</b> <span>The format to use for converted videos

                            <br /><br />

                            <div class="bold">MP4 (H.264/AAC)</div>
                            This format will use the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec for converted videos.  These videos will
                            play in flash player 9.0.115 or newer and offer the best quality. (recommended)
                            <br /><br />

                            <div class="bold">FLV (VP6/MP3)</div>
                            This format will use the VP6 video codec and MP3 audio codec for converted videos.  These videos
                            will play in flash player 8 or newer and offer the second best quality.  However, converting to this format
                            is very CPU intensive and I have found it to be the slowest of the three.
                            <br /><br />

                            <div class="bold">FLV (H.263/MP3)</div>
                            This format will use the H.263 video codec and MP3 audio codec for converted videos.  These videos will
                            play in older versions of flash, but offer the worst quality.  One advantage is this format will use the
                            least CPU and videos will be converted fastest in this format.
                            </span><br />

      <b>Video Size -</b> <span>The dimensions to use for converted videos.  This must be in WxH format!</span><br />

      <b>Video Quality -</b> <span>The bitrate or quality setting to use for the video portion of converted videos

                             <br /><br />

                             <div class="bold">MP4 (H.264/AAC)</div>
                             This format allows entering either a quality value or a bitrate value.  Quality values range from 2 to 40,
                             with larger numbers offering better quality.  Entering a value larger than 40 in this field will be
                             considered as a bitrate value.  A reasonable range for a bitrate setting is 512 to 5000, with larger
                             numbers offering better quality.

                             <br /><br />

                             If you are most concerned about video quality, use a quality setting.  Something in the neighborhood of 26
                             is a good compromise between filesize and quality.

                             <br /><br />

                             If you are most concerned about filesize, use a bitrate setting.  H.264 does quite well even at low
                             bitrates so you can go toward the low side (700 for SD video, 2000 for HD video) to really save
                             bandwidth and disk space.

                             <br /><br />

                             <div class="bold">FLV (VP6/MP3)</div>
                             This format allows only a bitrate setting.  A reasonable range for a bitrate setting is 512 to
                             5000, with larger numbers offering better quality.  This codec does not perform as well at lower
                             bitrates, so you will probably want to start with something around 1000.
                             <br /><br />

                             <div class="bold">FLV (H.263/MP3)</div>
                             This format allows only a bitrate setting.  A reasonable range for a bitrate setting is 512 to 5000, with
                             larger numbers offering better quality.  This codec does not perform nearly as well at lower bitrates, so
                             you will probably want to start with something around 1200.
                             <br /><br />

                             </span><br />

      <b>Audio Bitrate -</b> <span>The bitrate to use for the audio portion of converted videos.  Values of 56 up to 256 are acceptable.
                             Larger bitrates will give you better quality at the cost of larger files.  For MP3 audio, 128 is a good
                             compromise and for AAC 96.</span><br />

      <b>Thumbnail Size -</b> <span>The dimensions to use for thumbnails created from videos.  This must be in WxH format!</span><br />

      <b>Thumbnail Quality -</b> <span>The JPEG quality to use for generated thumbnails.  Larger numbers will give you higher quality
                                 images at the cost of larger files.  A setting of 80 is a good compromise between quality and size
                                 </span><br />

      <b>Thumbnail Amount -</b> <span>The number of thumbnails to generate for each video.  This allows selection from multiple thumbnails
                                of the image that will be used as a preview for the video.</span><br />

      <b>Letterbox -</b> <span>Check this box to have the video thumbnails letterboxed (black bars added) to maintain the aspect ratio of the video
                         while fitting the thumbnail into the size specified for <i>Thumbnail Size</i>.  If this box is left unchecked, the thumbnails
                         will instead be cropped to fit into the size specified for <i>Thumbnail Size</i></span><br />

                              This option will use a significant amount of server resources and is therefore recommended only for
                              high end dedicated servers.  The video conversion process can take anywhere from a few seconds to
                              several hours to complete, during which the uploaded videos will not be viewable.  Be sure to take this
                              into account when deciding on this option!

      TubeX uses a caching system for many of the end-user pages that it generates.  This caching system helps to reduce the load
      on your server by preventing pages from being dynamically generated each time someone hits the page.

      <br /><br />

      For example, assume that you have set a 3600 second (1 hour) cache for your main page.  The first visitor to that page will cause
      it to be generated and placed into the cache.  Any other visits to that page within the next hour by any user will result in the
      cached version of that page being displayed.  After the 3600 seconds has elapsed, the next visitor to the page will cause it to
      be re-generated (updated with any new videos, new stats, etc) and placed back into the cache.  The cycle then repeats itself.
