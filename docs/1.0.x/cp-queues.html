    <div class="section">
      TubeX uses a queue system to manage converting videos and generating thumbnails for videos.  This queue system
      ensures that your server does not get overloaded by many video conversion or thumbnailing processes running at the same time.
      Instead each video that needs to be converted or thumbnailed will be added to a queue and processed in the order it was added.

    <span class="header-section">Queue Interfaces</span>
    <div class="section">

      Through the TubeX control panel you can view and manage the queues.  When you access either the Conversion Queue or Thumbnail Queue functions in the Videos menu, a dialog window
      will appear that looks like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-queues.png" title="Queue Interface" />
      </div>

      <br />

      The Queue Details will include the following:

      <ul>
        <b>Queued Videos -</b> <span>The total number of items in the queue waiting to be processed</span><br />

        <b>Queue Processor -</b> <span>The status of the queue processor, either Running or Stopped</span><br />

        <b>Videos Processed -</b> <span>The total number of videos that have been successfully processed</span><br />

        <b>Average Time -</b> <span>The average amount of time it takes to process a video in the queue</span><br />

        <b>Estimated Time -</b> <span>The estimated amount of time remaining required to process all items in the queue</span><br />

        <b>Last Started -</b> <span>The date and time the queue process was last started</span><br />

        <b>Failed -</b> <span>The number of videos that were not able to be processed successfully</span><br />

        <b>Average Wait -</b> <span>The average amount of time an item waits in the queue before being processed</span><br />
      </ul>

      The Control Buttons available at the bottom of the queue interfaces are:

      <ul>
        <b>Start -</b> <span>
                         Press this button to start processing the items in the queue.  This button will only be available when the queue is not running.

                         <br /><br />
                         
                         <div class="message-notice">
                           It may not be possible to start the queue process through the control panel interfaces on all servers.  Your server will need to
                           have PHP safe_mode disabled, the PHP shell_exec() function available, and the CLI or CGI version of PHP available on the server.
                         </div>
                       </span><br />

        <b>Stop -</b> <span>Press this button to stop processing the items in the queue.  This button will only be available when the queue is already running.</span><br />

        <b>Clear Queue -</b> <span>Press this button to remove all items from the queue.  This button will only be available when the queue is not running.</span><br />

        <b>Close -</b> <span>Press this button to close the queue interface.  This will not have any affect on the operation of the queue (i.e. it will continue
                       running even if you close this interface)</span><br />
