    <span class="header-section">Search Page Fields</span>

    <div class="section">
      Any time you access a search interface, you will find search input fields near the top of the page that will look
      something like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-search-fields.png" title="Fields" border="1" />
      </div>

      <br />

      These search fields will allow you to quickly locate the specific items you are looking for.  The control panel search functions
      offer you a tremendous amount of power because you can search multiple fields at once to drill down and find exactly what you are
      looking for.  You can also sort the results any way you like, and do nested sub-sorting to as deep a level as you like.  The
      following sections will descibe each of the form fields in much more detail.
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Text Search Fields</span>

    <div class="section">

      Text search fields will only appear on a few of the search pages in the control panel interface.  Using this search field you
      can perform what is known as a "full text" search against the items in the database.  TubeX uses MySQL's built-in fulltext
      searching capabilities for these types of searches.  While you can accomplish the same type of search using the standard search
      fields, a text search will generally be much faster especially on large data sets.  Text search fields will look like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-search-fulltext-fields.png" title="Fields" />
      </div>

      <ul>
        <b>Search Term -</b> <span>Enter the term (or terms) that you would like to search for in this field</span><br />

        <b>Search Type -</b> <span>Text searches can be done using two different search algorithms:

                             <div class="bold" style="margin-top: 1em;">Natural Language</div>
                             This search type will take the search term you enter and try to find the most relevent matches.  The
                             search results will be returned in order, from most relevent to least relevent.  The Sort fields will
                             not have any affect when using this type of search.

                             This type of search does have a few limitations (set by MySQL):

                             <br /><br />

                             - Any words that appear in more than 50% of the items in the database will not be found as matches<br />
                             - Any words that are too short will be ignored (default is 4 characters)<br />
                             - Any common words that match the built in stop-word list (the, some, this, that, etc) will be ignored

                             <div class="bold" style="margin-top: 1em;">Boolean Mode</div>
                             This search type will allow you to search for matches on any words of a phrase, all words of a phrase, an
                             exact phrase, and much more.

                             <br /><br />

                             <div class="message-notice">
                               Much of this information is taken directly from the
                               <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/index.html" target="_blank">MySQL manual</a>.
                             </div>

                             <br />

                             Some words are ignored in boolean mode searches:<br />
                             - Any words that are too short will be ignored (default is 4 characters)<br />
                             - Any common words that match the built in stop-word list (the, some, this, that, etc) will be ignored

                             <br /><br />

                             The boolean full-text search capability supports the following operators:

                             <br /><br />

                             <ul>
                               <div class="larger bold mono">+</div>
                               A leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in each row that is returned.

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="larger bold mono">-</div>
                               A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any of the rows that are returned.

                               <br /><br />

                               Note: The - operator acts only to exclude rows that are otherwise matched by other search terms. Thus,
                               a boolean-mode search that contains only terms preceded by - returns an empty result. It does not
                               Match "all rows except those containing any of the excluded terms"

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="larger bold mono">(no operator)</div>
                               By default (when neither + nor - is specified) the word is optional, but the rows that contain it are
                               rated higher.

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="larger bold mono">*</div>
                               The asterisk serves as the truncation (or wildcard) operator. Unlike the other operators, it should be
                               appended to the word to be affected.  Words match if they begin with the word preceding the * operator.

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="larger bold mono">"</div>
                               A phrase that is enclosed within double quote characters matches only rows that contain the phrase
                               literally, as it was typed.
                             </ul>

                             <br /><br />

                             The following examples demonstrate some search strings that use boolean full-text operators:

                             <br /><br />

                             <ul>
                               <div class="larger bold mono">apple banana</div>
                               Find rows that contain at least one of the two words.

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="larger bold mono">+apple +juice</div>
                               Find rows that contain both words.

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="larger bold mono">+apple macintosh</div>
                               Find rows that contain the word apple, but rank rows higher if they also contain macintosh

                               <br /><br />

                               Find rows that contain the word apple, but not macintosh

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="larger bold mono">apple*</div>
                               Find rows that contain words such as apple, apples, applesauce or applet

                               <div class="larger bold mono">"some words"</div>
                                Find rows that contain the exact phrase "some words" (for example, rows that contain "some words of
                                wisdom" but not "some noise words".  Note that the " characters that enclose the phrase are operator
                                characters that delimit the phrase. They are not the quotes that enclose the search string itself.
                             </ul>

      The Search fields will appear on all search pages in the control panel, and are the heart of the search function.  Using these
      fields you can select the database fields to search, the type of matching to perform, and the search term you would like to use.
      You can also connect searches together using AND or OR logic!  The search fields will look something like this:

                           or OR as the connector.  When you select one of these options, you will see a new set of Search fields
                           appear directly below.  If you then change this option back to the empty value, the additional Search fields
                           will be removed.

                           Both (the one containing the AND, and the one directly after) of the searches must match in order for the
                           item to be returned as a result
                           <br /><br />

                           <div class="bold">OR</div>
                           Either (the one containing the OR, and the one directly after) of the two sets of searches can match in
                           order for the item to be returned as a result

    <span class="header-section">Sort Fields</span>

    <div class="section">
      The sort fields allow you to control how the search results are sorted and how many are displayed on each page.  They will look
      something like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-search-sort-fields.png" title="Fields" />
      </div>

      <ul>
        <b>Sort Field -</b> <span>Select the database field by which you would like the search results sorted.  The sort fields are
                            grouped by type (the bold italicized entries) which allow you to sort by a wide variety of database fields
                            related to the current item type you are searching</span><br />

        <b>Sort Direction -</b> <span>Select the direction in which the search results should be sorted.  Ascending will sort from
                                smallest to largest, and Descending will sort from largest to smallest</span><br />

        <b>Connector -</b> <span>The connector field allows you to do sub-sorting of the search results.  If you select the "then"
                           option, you will see a new set of sorting fields appear which you can use to control how items with the same
                           value for the previous sorting item will be sorted.  Selecting the empty value will cause the additional set
                           of fields to be removed.

                           <br /><br />

                           As an example, assume you wanted to sort the user accounts by their birthday first.  It is possible that
                           several user accounts will have the same birthday, so you can use a connector to sub-sort those accounts.
                           You might decide to sub-sort them by their signup date so you can see which person with a particular
                           birthday signed up first.</span><br />

        <b>Per Page -</b> <span>Enter the number of search results to show on each page.  This can be any numerical value greater than
                          zero</span><br />
