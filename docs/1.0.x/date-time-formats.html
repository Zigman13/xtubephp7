      TubeX allows you to set the format that you want dates and times displayed in.  Many countries use differing formats to display
      their dates and times, so this feature will allow you to have your dates and times in a format that the majority of your visitors
      will understand.  The date and time format system used by TubeX is based on the date and time format feature of PHP.  If you have
      experience working with PHP date and time formats, you'll have no problem with these.  Even if you don't, these formats are very
      straight forward and easy to understand.

    <div class="section">
      The date and time formats you want to use are configured through the TubeX Global Settings interface.  In the control panel, select
      the Global Settings option from the Settings menu.  The Global Settings pop window will display, and in the Localization Settings section you will
      find the Date Format and Time Format fields. This is where you will make the changes to your date and time formats.  Once you have made the
      changes you want, press the Apply Changes button to save your new settings.

      Date and time format specifiers consist of a series of characters.  You can find a complete list of these characters below for both dates and
      times.  Using a combination of these specifiers you can create complete date and time formats.  Note that TubeX will only pay attention to
      the defined characters; all other characters in your date or time format will be left alone.  This allows you to use separators such as forward-slashes,
      dashes, and colons as you like.
