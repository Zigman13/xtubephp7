    <span class="header-section">Managing Banners</span>
    <div class="section">
      Managing banners is done by accessing the Settings &gt; Banners &gt; Search Banners function in the control panel menu.
      From this interface you can add new banners and search, edit, or delete the existing banners.  For an overview of searching,
      adding, editing, and deleting items, please see the <a href="cp-basics.html">Control Panel Basics</a> section of this software manual.
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Database Fields</span>
    <div class="section">
      Banners have the following fields associated with them:

      <ul>
        <b>Banner ID -</b> <span>The ID number assigned to the banner.  ID numbers are generated in sequential order automatically by the software.</span><br />

        <b>Sponsor -</b> <span>The sponsor associated with this banner</span><br />

        <b>Zone -</b> <span>The zone in which this banner can be displayed.  Zones can be any text string that you like, and will be used with the zone attribute
                      of the {banner} template function.  For example, if you wanted to restrict the banners that are displayed directly under the search bar you
                      might use a zone named "Under Search Bar".  All banners that you want to be able to appear in that location should be assigned the same Zone.

                      <br /><br />

                      Then in your site templates you can use a {banner} function like so:

                      <xmp>{banner zone="Under Search Bar"}</xmp>
                      </span><br />

        <b>Tags -</b> <span>The tags that have been assigned to the banner.  The tags attribute of the {banner} template function can be used to select only banners
                      with specific tags</span><br />

        <b>Times Displayed -</b> <span>The number of times this banner has been selected for display</span><br />

        <b>Banner HTML -</b> <span>
                               The complete HTML code to use for this banner.  Within this HTML code there are some template variables that you can utilize:

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="bold">{$upload_file}</div>
                               See the <i>Uploading Content</i> section below for a complete description.

                               <br /><br />

                               <div class="bold">{$sponsor_url}</div>
                               If you have selected a sponsor for this banner, this value will be replaced by the URL associated with that sponsor.
                             </span><br />
      </ul>
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Uploading Content</span>
    <div class="section">
      When adding or editing a banner you have the option to upload some content which will be associated with the banner.  This is useful if you want to upload an image file,
      a swf flash file, or anything else.  When uploading content it is necessary to use the special template variable {$upload_file} in the Banner HTML value
      to specify where you want the URL of the uploaded content to be placed.

      <br /><br />

      For example, assume you are uploading a JPEG image named banner.jpg.  You would select that file to be the upload content and for the Banner HTML you would use something like this:

      <xmp><a href="http://www.sponsor.com/"><img src="{$upload_file}" border="0" /></a></xmp>

      The software will process the file that you upload and replace the {$upload_file} template variable with the correct path to the uploaded file.
