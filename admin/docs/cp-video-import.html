      Many adult sponsors offer hosted videos that you can import using this feature of TubeX.  This will quickly give you a large amount of content for your
      tube site, and of course you will make money from the sales that you refer!  I am maintaining a <a href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/sponsors.php" target="_blank">
      list of sponsors that offer hosted videos</a> and will continue to update that list as more are found.

    <span class="header-section">Import Data Format</span>
    <div class="section">
      The import data will need to contain the information for one video per line, and each line should contain delimited text (strings separated by
      a unique character).  The video information can be in any order, but that order must remain the same throughout the data.  Here is an example:

      <pre class="code">

        The above example has four videos each with the URL to the video file, the URL to the thumbnail preview, the video title, the video description, and the video tags.
        This particular example uses the pipe character (|) as the delimiter, but that is not required.  The delimiter can be any unique character that is only used to delimit
        the fields in the data and does not appear in any other parts of the data.

        <br /><br />

        Once you have your video data in the proper format, you can begin the importing process.
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Step One - Import Sources</span>
    <div class="section">
      To start the import process, access the Videos &gt; Import Videos function from the control panel menu.  This will load a page where you will select the import source, which will
      look like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-video-import-step-one.png" title="Import Sources" border="0" />
      </div>

      <ul>
        <b>Source -</b> <span>
                          Select the source for the import data.  Possibilities are:

                          <br /><br />

                          <div class="bold">Clipboard</div>
                          This option will allow you to paste the import data from your clipboard into a large text input field
                          <br /><br />

                          <div class="bold">Upload</div>
                          This option will allow you to select and upload a text file containing the import data
                          <br /><br />

                          <div class="bold">URL</div>
                          This option will allow you to enter the URL to a text file containing the import data

                        </span><br />

        <b>Delimiter -</b> <span>Enter the character (or characters) that is used in the data to delimit the video information on each line</span><br />

        <b>Clipboard -</b> <span>This will only appear when source is set to Clipboard.  You can paste the import data into this field.</span><br />

        <b>File -</b> <span>This will only appear when source is set to Upload.  Select the file from your computer that contains the import data.</span><br />

        <b>URL -</b> <span>This will only appear when source is set to URL.  Enter the full HTTP URL to the location of the text file that contains the import data.</span><br />
      </ul>

      Once you have configured the source settings, press the Next Step &gt; button to continue the import process.
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Step Two - Configuring Import Settings</span>
    <div class="section">
      TubeX will process the source that you provided, and then provide an analysis of the data.  On this page you will be able to tell TubeX what each field in the import data
      should be assigned to for each video that is added.  The interface will look like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-video-import-step-two.png" title="Import Sources" border="1" />
      </div>

      <div class="bold">Define the Data Format</div>
      This section will show you the first line of the import data, split up based on the delimiter and displayed so you can assign the appropriate type to each piece of data.
      Use the drop down selection fields to assign the correct type for each field.  Each type is described below.

      <ul>
        <b>Title -</b> <span>The video title</span><br />

        <b>Gallery URL -</b> <span>The full HTTP URL that points to a TGP movie gallery.  The videos and thumbnails will be extracted from the gallery for use

        <b>Video URL -</b> <span>The full HTTP URL that points directly to the video file</span><br />

        <b>Base Video URL -</b> <span>The full HTTP URL that points to the directory in which the video files are located.  This must be used in

        <b>Video Filename -</b> <span>The filename(s) of the video file(s).  This can either be a single filename, or a comma separated list of filenames.</span><br />

        <b>Thumbnail Filename -</b> <span>The filename(s) of the thumbnail image(s).  This can either be a single filename, or a comma separated list of filenames.</span><br />

      <ul>
        <b>Sponsor -</b> <span> All videos imported will be assigned this sponsor.</span><br />

        <b>Category -</b> <span>
                            The default category to use for imported videos.  Videos which cannot be categorized using the
                            <a href="cp-category.html#automatic-categorization" target="_blank">Automatic Categorization</a> feature will be assigned to this category.
                          </span><br />

        <b>Username -</b> <span>The username to set for all imported videos</span><br />

      </ul>


      <div class="bold">Import Settings</div>
      This section will allow you to configure some additional import settings.

      <ul class="wider">
        <b>Queue for conversion -</b> <span>Check this box to have the imported videos added to the conversion queue.  The conversion queue will download the video file(s), convert
                                      them into the format you have specified in the Global Settings interface, and the converted videos will be hosted from your server.  Videos that
                                      are queued for conversion will not appear on your site until they have been converted.</span><br />

        <b>Queue for thumbnail generation -</b> <span>Check this box to have the imported videos added to the thumbnail generation queue.  Thumbnail generation will
                                                download the video file(s) from the remote server and generate preview thumbnails from them.  The video files will be
                                                deleted after the thumbnails have been generated and the videos shown on your site will still be hotlinked from the
                                                URL provided during the import process.</span><br />

      </ul>

    </div>


    <span class="header-section">Importing</span>
    <div class="section">
      Once you have configured the data format and default settings, press the Import Videos button.  This will start the import process and will display a progress bar letting you
      know how much of the import process has been completed.  Importing can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on how many videos are included in the import
      data.  After all of the import data has been processed, a notification message will let you know how many videos were imported.
