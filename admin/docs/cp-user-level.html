      User Levels have the following fields associated with them:
      <ul>
        <b>Name -</b> <span>The friendly name assigned to this user level</span><br />

        <b>View Limit -</b> <span>The number of videos that user accounts assigned to this user level are allowed to view each day</span><br />

        <b>Bandwidth Limit -</b> <span>
                                   The amount of bandwidth that user accounts assigned to this user level are allowed to consume each day.  This can either be a numerical
                                   value (interpreted as bytes) or a numerical value followed by one of these suffixes: KB, MB, GB

                                   <br /><br />

                                     Bandwidth limits apply only to locally hosted videos.  Videos that use embed code or are hotlinked will not count toward the bandwidth
                                     limit.
