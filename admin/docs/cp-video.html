    <span class="header-section">Managing Videos</span>
    <div class="section">
      Managing videos is done by accessing the Videos &gt; Search Videos function in the control panel menu.
      From this interface you can add new videos and search, edit, or delete the existing videos.  For an overview of searching,
      adding, editing, and deleting items, please see the <a href="cp-basics.html">Control Panel Basics</a> section of this software manual.
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Videos &amp; Clips</span>
    <div class="section">
      In TubeX there is an important distinction between Videos and Clips.  When talking about a Video, that is referencing a complete video object which contains
      the video title, description, tags, category, and clips.

      <br /><br />

      A Clip, on the other hand, is an individual video file or embed code that is associated with a video.  Each video can have multiple clips, but each clip can
      only be associated with a single video.
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Video Sources</span>
    <div class="section">
      Videos can be added through the control panel from a number of different sources.  Those are:

      <ul>
        <b>Uploads -</b> <span>
                           This option allows you to upload files from your computer.  Multiple files can be uploaded, and multiple
                           file types are supported.  Click the <img src="../images/add-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: middle" /> icon to add more upload fields,
                           or the <img src="../images/remove-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: middle" /> icon to remove an upload field.  The supported file types are:

                           <br /><br />

                           <div class="bold">Video Files</div>
                           Any video files that are uploaded will be used as the clips for the video.  Multiple video files can be uploaded
                           for a single video.
                           <br /><br />

                           <div class="bold">JPEG Image Files</div>
                           Any JPEG image files that are uploaded will be resized (if possible) and used as the preview thumbnails for the video
                           if it is not possible for the software to automatically generate thumbnails from the video files that were uploaded.
                           <br /><br />

                           <div class="bold">Zip Archives</div>
                           Zip files are supported on servers where the PHP zip extension is installed.  All video files will be extracted
                           from the archive and used as the clips for the video.  All JPEG image files will be extracted, resized if possible,
                           and used as the preview thumbnails for the video if it is not possible for the software to automatically generate
                           thumbnails from the video files that were extracted.

                         </span><br />

        <b>URLs -</b> <span>
                        This option allows you to enter URLs to files hosted on HTTP servers.  Multiple URLs can be entered, and multiple file types
                        are supported.  Click the <img src="../images/add-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: middle" /> icon to add more URL fields,
                        or the <img src="../images/remove-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: middle" /> icon to remove an URL field.  The supported file types are:

                        <br /><br />

                        <div class="message-notice">
                          If you select the hotlink option, the software will not be able to determine the video duration so you will need to fill in
                          the Video Duration field!
                        </div>

                        <br />

                        <div class="bold">Video Files</div>
                        You can enter the direct URL to a video file.  Multiple video file URLs can be entered for a single video.
                        If you choose the hotlink option, the videos will be loaded from the URL you enter.  Otherwise, the videos will
                        be downloaded and served from your server.
                        <br /><br />

                        <div class="bold">JPEG Image Files</div>
                        You can enter the direct URL to a JPEG image file.  Multiple image file URLs can be entered for a single video.
                        The JPEG image files will be downloaded from the URL(s), resized if possible, and used as the preview thumbnails
                        for the video if you have selected to hotlink the videos or the software is not able to automatically generate
                        preview thumbnails from the video files.
                        <br /><br />

                        <div class="bold">Zip Archives</div>
                        Zip files are supported on servers where the PHP zip extension is installed.  The Zip Archives will be downloaded to your server.
                        All video files will be extracted and used as the clips for the video.  All JPEG image files will be extracted, resized if possible,
                        and used as the preview thumbnails for the video if it is not possible for the software to automatically generate
                        thumbnails from the video files that were extracted.

                      </span><br />

        <b>Gallery -</b> <span>
                           This option allows you to enter the HTTP URL of a TGP gallery that contains videos.  A TGP gallery is considered to be a page
                           which contains JPEG images which link directly to video files.  The software will locate all of the JPEG images that link to
                           video files, and download the JPEG images to your server.  If you select the hotlink option, the videos will be linked from
                           the server hosting the gallery, otherwise they will be downloaded and served from your server.

                           <br /><br />

                           <div class="message-notice">
                             If you select the hotlink option, the software will not be able to determine the video duration so you will need to fill in
                             the Video Duration field!
                           </div>

                           <br />

                           The JPEG images from the gallery will be resized if possible and used as preview thumbnails for the video when the hotlink option
                           is enabled or if the software is unable to automatically generate thumbnails from the downloaded video files.
                         </span><br />

        <b>Embed Code -</b> <span>
                              This option allows you to specify the exact &lt;embed&gt; or &lt;object&gt; code to use for the video.  This is useful for embedding
                              videos from other tube sites.

                              <br /><br />

                              When using this source type, it is necessary to fill in the Video Duration field specifying the length of the video.  You can also optionally
                              upload thumbnail preview images (JPEG format) to be used for the video, since the software cannot generate preview thumbnails from embed code.
                            </span><br />
      </ul>

      Some of the video sources have additional settings and options.  Those are:

      <ul class="wider">
        <b>Hotlink video clips -</b> <span>This will be an option for URLs and Gallery sources.  If this box is checked, the video files will be hotlinked from the
                                     server where the URL points (for URLs source) or where the gallery is hosted (for Gallery source).  Be sure to verify that hotlinking
                                     is allowed before you use this option!</span><br />

        <b>Queue for thumbnail generation -</b> <span>This will be an option for URLs and Gallery sources.  Check this box to have the video added to the thumbnail generation queue.
                                                Thumbnail generation will download the video file(s) from the remote server and generate preview thumbnails from them.  The video files will be
                                                deleted after the thumbnails have been generated, and the videos will be hotlinked when viewed on your site.

                                                <br /><br />

                                                <div class="message-notice">
                                                  This is only valid when hotlinking the video clips

                                                </span><br />

        <b>Queue video for conversion  -</b> <span>This will be an option for all sources except Embed Code.  Check this box to have the video(s) added to the conversion queue.
                                             The conversion queue will download the video file(s) (if necessary), convert them into the format you have specified in the Global Settings interface,
                                             and the converted videos will be hosted from your server.  Videos that are queued for conversion will not appear on your site until they
                                             have been converted.</span><br />
