    <div class="message-notice">
      If you are moving your installation to a new server or to a new domain on the same server, please follow the instructions in the
      <a href="install-move.html">Moving Your Installation</a> portion of this manual.

      <br /><br />

      Unless otherwise noted, you are licensed to install the software on a single domain. If you would like to install the software
      on more than one domain, you will need to purchase additional licenses. Additional licenses may be purchased though the
      <a href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/my-account/" target="_blank">My Account</a> interface at a discounted rate.

    <div class="header-section">Introduction</div>

    <div class="section">
      Before you begin the installation you should have the following information on hand:

      <br /><br />

      - The name of the MySQL database which you will be using to store the data*<br />
      - The username which you use to access the MySQL database<br />
      - The password which you use to access the MySQL database

      <br /><br />

      If you do not have this information, contact your server administrator to get it.

      <br /><br />

      * This name is not something you can just make up. The database must be created by your
      server administrator in order for you to use it. If you don't know the name of a database
      which you are allowed to use, contact your server administrator to get that information
      or to have them create a database for you.  Some servers offer control panels where you
      can create your own MySQL database.  In that case you will need to have created the MySQL
      database before you continue.
    </div>



    <div class="header-section">Uploading Files</div>

    <div class="section">
      Now you are ready to begin uploading the files to your server, but you will need to extract the software
      archive if you haven't already done so.  Be sure when you extract the archive (using your favorite zip or
      tar.gz file extractor) that you maintain the directory structure of the archive.  In most extraction programs
      this is the default setting, but you should double check to make sure.

      <br /><br />

      Once the archive has been extracted, simply upload all of the TubeX distribution's files and directories <b>(except the utilities directory)</b>
      to your server into the directory where you want TubeX to run.  TubeX can be installed to the base directory or any sub-directory
      of your site.

      <br /><br />

      Assuming you installed TubeX into a directory named tubex, the base TubeX directory structure should look like this:

      <pre style="padding-left: 20px">tubex/admin/
tubex/admin/classes/
tubex/admin/css/
tubex/admin/docs/
tubex/admin/images/
tubex/admin/includes/
tubex/admin/js/
tubex/admin/player/
tubex/classes/
tubex/data/
tubex/includes/
tubex/js/
tubex/language/
tubex/player/
tubex/swfupload/
tubex/temp/
tubex/templates/
tubex/templates/_cache/
tubex/templates/_compiled/
tubex/templates/Adult-Dark/
tubex/templates/Adult-Dark-Rewrite/
tubex/templates/Adult-Light/
tubex/templates/Adult-Light-Rewrite/
tubex/templates/Default-Blue/
tubex/templates/Default-Blue-Rewrite/
tubex/uploads/
tubex/videos/</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="header-section">Setting Permissions</div>

    <div class="section">
      Next, you will need to set permissions on the directories and files that TubeX will be
      using. If you are not sure how to set permissions, consult the documentation for your FTP client
      and/or contact your server administrator for more information. Below is a table containing the
      permissions you will need to set on each directory or file.  If you do not see a file or directory
      listed, it means you do not need to change the permissions on that file or directory

      <br /><br />

        <table width="400" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0" style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;">

            <td align="center">666</td>

          <tr bgcolor="#ececec">
            <td>All template files*</td>
            <td align="center">666</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <div style="font-size: 80%;">
        * Template files are those located in the sub-directories of the templates directory, for example all files inside
        the templates/Default-Blue directory</div>
      </ul>

      These are only the recommended file permissions, and may need to be altered depending on your server configuration.
    </div>



    <div class="header-section">Software Initialization</div>

    <div class="section">
      You are now ready to begin the web based portion of the setup. In your browser, type in the full URL to the install.php file on your server,
      which is located in the admin directory of your TubeX installation.  So, for example, if you installed TubeX in a directory named tubex, you would
      access the install.php script with the following URL:

      <pre style="padding-left: 20px">http://www.yoursite.com/tubex/admin/install.php</pre>

      The install.php script will run a few diagnostic tests to make sure your server has all of the required modules and that all of the permissions
      have been set correctly.  If there are any problems, a page will be displayed that details them.

      <br /><br />

      If all of the diagnostic tests pass, you will see a page where you will need to enter your MySQL database information.  Once you have filled in all
      of the fields with your MySQL information, press the Submit button.  The MySQL database information will be tested to make sure it is working.  If it is not,
      you will get an error message indicating the problem and you will need to try again.

      <br /><br />

      If the MySQL information is entered correctly, you will be brought to a page that will have the URL and login information for the control panel.
      Be sure to write down your control panel username and password before continuing to the next step!
    </div>



    <div class="header-section">Accessing the Control Panel</div>

    <div class="section">
      On the final screen of the install.php script you will find a link to the control panel.  Click that link and enter the login information indicated
      on the final install.php screen.  This will log you into the control panel so you can setup the software's options.  The first time you login to the
      control panel, the Global Settings window will pop-up.  In this popup window you will be able to configure the various options that TubeX has available.
      You can click on the <img src="../images/help-22x22.png" border="0" style="vertical-align: middle;"> icon to get a description of each of the software options.
      After you have set all of the options how you want them, you can click on the Apply Changes button at the bottom of the Global Settings dialog.

      <br /><br />

      <div class="message-notice">
      You must save the software settings before you can access the other control panel functions.  The global settings
      window will continue to popup until you correctly save your settings.
      </div>

      <br />

      You are now ready to begin using the software.  From here you should read the <a href="first-steps.html">First Steps</a> portion of the manual.  That document
      will provide recommended steps to take before you open your site for visitors.

      <br /><br />

        <br /><br />

        If you have uploaded the TubeX zip (or tar.gz) file to your server, remove it now. Leaving it on
        your server provides a chance for other users to steal it from your web space. Make sure you never leave a copy of
        the software archive where other people can access it.

        <br /><br />

        Never share your software with anyone. The license you purchased is for your use only. You may not give or sell the software
        to anyone under any circumstances. If you are caught doing this, you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

        <br /><br />

        Never share your owners lounge username or password with anyone. Again, that is for your use only. We will never
        ask for you to send your password to us, so if you ever get an e-mail requesting it you should not send it.

        <br /><br />

        If you ever find a site that is offering our software for download, please contact us immediately so we can have
        the site shut down. Every time our software is pirated instead of purchased, it means less resources for us to continue
        the development of this and future software.
