      This function will generate a complete dump of the TubeX MySQL database tables so they can be restored in an emergency or if moving your installation to a new server.
      To use the database optimize feature access the Database &gt; Utilities function from the control panel menu.  You will find a section titled <i class="bold">Database Backup</i>
      with details on where the backup file will be generated.  Simply enter a filename (a .sql file extension is recommended) and press the <i class="bold">Run Database Backup</i>
      button to generate the backup.

      <br /><br />

      After the backup is generated, you may wish to download this file to your local computer for safe keeping.  The directory in which the backup file is generated will be
      indicated, so you can access that directory to download the file.

    <a class="header-section" name="restore">Database Restore</a>
    <div class="section">
      This function can restore your MySQL database tables to the state they were in at the time the backup file was generated.  Only backup files generated by the TubeX Database Backup
      function can be used.   To use this function you will first need to place a backup file in the data directory of your TubeX installation.  The backup file should have a .sql file extension.

      <br /><br />

      Once the backup file is in the data directory, access the Database &gt; Utilities function from the control panel menu.  You will find a section titled <i class="bold">Database Restore</i>
      which will contain a list of the .sql files in the data directory.  Select the backup file you would like to restore from and press the <i class="bold">Run Database Restore</i>
      button to restore that data into your MySQL database.
    </div>



    <a class="header-section" name="optimize">Database Optimize</a>
    <div class="section">
      This function allows you to "cleanup" the MySQL database tables that TubeX uses so they are optimized for both
      speed and disk usage.  In general, you will not need to run this command more than once every few weeks, as MySQL is quite efficient in
      maintaining it's data files.  The only time you may need to run it more often is if you delete a large number of videos or other items
      from your database.

      <br />
      <br />

      To use the database optimize feature access the Database &gt; Utilities function from the control panel menu.  This will load the database utilities page
      where you fill find a button labeled <i class="bold">Run Database Optimize Now</i>.  Simply click this button to run the optimization operation.
    </div>



    <a class="header-section" name="repair">Database Repair</a>
    <div class="section">
      In some cases, usually after your server recovers from a serious error, your MySQL database may become corrupted.  When this happens you will
      get error messages from TubeX indicating that there is a problem with one or more of your database tables.  In most circumstances MySQL
      is able to repair damaged tables with it's built in functions.  TubeX allows you to run these built in functions through the Database &gt; Utilities
      interface.  If you ever get these types of error messages, simply login to the control panel and use the Database Repair function.

    <a class="header-section" name="raw">Raw Database Query</a>
    <div class="section">
      This function allows you to run a raw SQL query against the MySQL database that is storing the TubeX data.  This feature is intended for advanced users who have experience working
      with SQL queries and understand the impact they will have on the database.  In most cases you will not need to use this feature, unless you have been specifically instructed to
      do so for tech support purposes.
