    <div class="section">
      Editing the e-mail templates is done through the Templates &gt; E-mail Templates function in the control panel.  That interface will look
      something like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-templates-email.png" title="Site Templates" />

                                   <span>Click this icon to bring up the Search and Replace dialog where you can perform a search and replace on many templates at once.</span><br />


                                   <img src="../images/save-32x32.png" />
                                   <span>Click this icon to save the currently loaded template</span><br />

                                   <img src="../images/reload-32x32.png" />
                                   <span>Click this icon to reload the template code for the currently loaded template.  This is useful when you do a search and replace which
                                   affects the current template you are editing.</span><br />

                                   <img src="../images/help-32x32.png" />

                                   </span>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <span class="header-section">Search and Replace</span>
    <div class="section">
      TubeX allows you to make quick changes to your templates in bulk with the Search and Replace function.  When you access the Search and Replace function a dialog will appear that will allow you
      to select the templates that you want to perform this action on, the code to search for in the template, and the replacement code to use.  Multiple templates can be selected by holding down the shift or ctrl
      keys on your keyboard as you click on templates in the selection list.  Once you have selected the templates and entered the search and replacement code, press the Apply Changes button to start the task.
      Once completed a notification message will be displayed letting you know how many replacements were made.
    </div>


    <span class="header-section">Greeting and Signature Templates</span>
    <div class="section">
      There are two special e-mail templates that you can edit which only allow configuring of the Message Body and do not have a Subject.  Those are:

      <ul>
        <b style="width: 20%;">email-global-greeting.tpl -</b> <span>Use this template to control the text that is appended to the beginning of every e-mail message sent by the software.
                                                               This is a good place to put a simple greeting.</span><br />

        <b style="width: 20%;">email-global-signature.tpl -</b> <span>Use this template to control the text that is appended to the end of every e-mail message sent by the software.  This is
                                                                a good place to put your signature, a privacy notice, a link to your site, etc.</span><br />
      </ul>

    </div>
