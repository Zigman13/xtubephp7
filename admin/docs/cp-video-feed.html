      From this interface you can add new video feeds and search, edit, or delete the existing video feeds.  For an overview of searching,
      adding, editing, and deleting items, please see the <a href="cp-basics.html">Control Panel Basics</a> section of this software manual.

        <b>Feed URL -</b> <span>The full URL to the feed</span><br />

        <b>Feed Type -</b> <span>
                             The type of feed.  The following feed types are supported:

                             <br /><br />

                             <div class="bold">XML Videos Feed</div>
                             This is a feed that meets <a href="xml-videos-feed.html" target="_blank">this specification</a>.  These types of
                             feeds are often offered by adult sponsors.  A list of sponsors that offer these feeds is maintained in the
                             <a href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/support/viewtopic/5410/" target="_blank">TubeX forum</a>.

                             <br /><br />

                             When videos are imported from this type of feed, the actual video clips will be hotlinked from the remote server so
                             it won't use any of your bandwidth.  The preview thumbnail images will be downloaded to your server, resized if possible,
                             and used as the preview images for this video.

                             <br /><br />

                             Videos imported from a YouTube feed will use the embed code provided by YouTube.  This will display the YouTube player, and the video will be loaded from
                             YouTube's servers so it won't use your bandwidth.

                             <br /><br />

                             The preview thumbnail images for the video will be downloaded to your server and used as the preview images for imported videos.

    <span class="header-section">Individual Functions</span>
    <div class="section">
      Besides the <a href="cp-common-functions.html">Common Functions</a> available for most items, video feeds also have some custom functions that can be run.  The icons that appear for each
      video feed in the Search Feeds interface are described below.

      <ul>
        <b><img src="../images/feed-read-22x22.png" /> -</b> <span>Click this to have the software read the feed and import the videos it finds in the feed.  The software will keep track of what videos
                                                             were imported from each feed to prevent duplicates from being imported.  Because of this, it will not be too uncommon to receive a message
                                                             that 0 videos were imported from the feed when running this function.

                                                             <br /><br />

                                                             <div class="message-notice">
                                                               Videos can also be imported from feeds using <a href="cron.html" target="_blank">cron</a>.  This will allow you to have videos imported
                                                               from your feeds automatically without any interaction from an administrator.
