    <span class="header-section">Authentication</span>

    <div class="section">
      Accessing the TubeX control panel interface requires username and password authentication.  When you access the control panel and
      it determines that authentication is required, you will see a screen that displays the following login prompt:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-login.png" title="Login" border="1" />
      </div>

      <br />

      It is possible to setup many control panel accounts, each with their own username, password, and privileges.  You can find
      additional information about control panel accounts in the <a href="cp-administrator.html" target="_blank">Administrators</a>
      section of the documentation.

      <br /><br />

      The authentication screen fields are as follows:

      <ul>
        <b>Username -</b> <span>Enter the username for the control panel account you want to login as</span><br />

        <b>Password -</b> <span>Enter the password associated with the control panel username you entered</span><br />

        <b>Remember Me -</b> <span>Check this box if you would like your control panel login information to be stored in a cookie so
                             you will be automatically logged in the next time you access the control panel.  This option will store
                             your login information for up to 90 days.</span>
      </ul>

      Once you have filled in the fields, press the Login button to authenticate the information provided and log you in to the control
      panel interface.  Each time you login, you will be taken to the main page of the control panel interface, which is covered in the
      next section.
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Main Page</span>

    <div class="section">
      Each time you login to the TubeX control panel or click on the TubeX logo, you will be taken to the main control panel page.
      This page will display links to most of the main software functions, as well as an area that shows new videos, users, and may
      have additional information in future releases.  The main page will look something like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-main.png" title="Main Page" />
      </div>

      <ul>
        <b>Logo/Home -</b> <span>Click the logo at any time to return to the main page</span><br />

        <b>Menu -</b> <span>The menu allows you to access the control panel functions at any time from any of the control panel
                      interfaces.  Hovering your mouse pointer over a menu item will cause the options for that menu to appear below.
                      Click on any of the options to access that control panel function.</span><br />

        <b>Log Out Button -</b> <span>Click this button at any time to log out of the control panel interface.  This will erase your
                                stored login information (even if using the Remember Me option) and you will have to enter your
                                username and password the next time you access the control panel.</span><br />

        <b>Notification Area -</b> <span>This section of the page is where notification messages will be displayed.  You will receive
                                   notification messages frequently when working in the control panel, so be sure to keep an eye on
                                   this area!</span><br />

        <b>Quick Function Access -</b> <span>On the main control panel page you will have quick access (instead of going through the
                                       menu system) to most of the main functions.  Click any of the links in this area to access the
                                       associated function.</span><br />
      </ul>
    </div>



    <span class="header-section">Search Pages</span>

    <div class="section">
      One of the primary tasks you will be doing in the control panel is searching for items.  To make searching easier to master, all
      of the search interfaces in the control panel use the same basic layout.  Once you have learned to search one type of item, you
      will also know how to search for any type of item!  The search pages will look something like this:

      <br /><br />

      <div class="centered">
        <img src="images/cp-search.png" title="Search Page" />
      </div>

      <ul>
        <b>Search/Sorting Options -</b> <span>Use this section of the search interface to specify what you are looking for and how you
                                        would like the results sorted.  A more detailed discussion of the search and sorting options
                                        can be found in the <a href="cp-searching.html" target="_blank">Searching</a> section of the
                                        documentation.</span><br />

        <b>Notification Message -</b> <span>Notification messages will appear when you perform an action on one or more of the items
                                      displayed in the search results.  Messages with white text are simple informative messages (as in
                                      this example), whereas error messages will be displayed in red text.  Notifications can be closed
                                      by clicking the X in the upper left-hand corner, and will also dissappear on their own after a
                                      short time.</span><br />

        <b>Item Functions -</b> <span>Each item in the search results will have one or more functions that you can apply to that
                                individual item.  Those function icons will appear for each item in the search results, and you can
                                click on those icons to perform the associated action.  The generic actions are described in more
                                detail below, and actions specific for an item type are described in that item type's documentation.
                                </span><br />

        <b>Toolbar -</b> <span>The toolbar will appear at the bottom of the search pages, and will always remain at the bottom of the
                         page even as you scroll through the search results.  This allows you to quickly access any of the functions at
                         any time.</span><br />

        <b>Page Navigation -</b> <span>The page navigation section of the toolbar allows you to page through the search results, if
                                 there are multiple pages of results.  You can use the icons to navigate the pages, or enter a page
                                 number in the text input field.  After you enter a number in the text input field, press the Enter
                                 (or Return) key on your keyboard to jump to that page.

                                 </span><br />

        <b>Toolbar Functions -</b> <span>The middle section of the toolbar will contain various icons for functions that can be
                                   executed in relation to the current search items.  Clicking a toolbar function icon when you have
                                   none of the search results selected (using their associated checkboxes) will run that function on
                                   all of the items that match your current search.  If you do have items checked, the function will be
                                   run on only those items.

                                   <br /><br />

                                   There are a few common icons that will appear on most search page toolbars.  Those include the
                                   following:

    <div class="section">

      Dialogs are used throughout the control panel interface when it is necessary to collect or modify data (commonly when adding or
      editing an item).  When a dialog is needed, it will be displayed over top of the main control panel interface, and will look
      something like this:
