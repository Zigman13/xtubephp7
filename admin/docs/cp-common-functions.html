    <div class="section">
      Item functions are the icons that appear for each item in the search results, and will be applied only to the corresponding item.

      A few of the item functions are very common and will be seen for most items in the control panel.  Those are:

      <ul>
        <b><img src="../images/edit-22x22.png" /> -</b> <span>Edit the item.  When you click this icon, a dialog will appear which will have a form that is pre-filled with
                                                        the item's current settings which you can modify as needed.</span><br />

        <b><img src="../images/email-22x22.png" /> -</b> <span>E-mail the item.  When you click this icon, a dialog will appear where you can enter the subject and message of
                                                         the e-mail that you would like to send.</span><br />

        <b><img src="../images/delete-22x22.png" /> -</b> <span>Delete the item.  When you click this icon, you will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the item.  If you
                                                          confirm the deletion, the item will be permanently removed from the database.  <i class="bold">This cannot be undone!</i></span><br />
      </ul>
    </div>




    <span class="header-section">Toolbar Functions</span>
    <div class="section">
      Icons on the toolbar will be applied to multiple items at once.  The items to which the function is applied will depend on whether or not you have checked
      any of the item checkboxes.  If any checkboxes are checked, only those checked items will be affected.  If no checkboxes are checked, the function will be
      applied to all items that match the current search you have performed.

                                                         can use template values to customize the exact contents of the message.</span><br />
