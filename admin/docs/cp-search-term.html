    <span class="header-section">Managing Search Terms</span>
    <div class="section">
      Managing search terms is done by accessing the Settings &gt; Search Terms function in the control panel menu.
      From this interface you can add new search terms and search, edit, or delete the existing search terms.  For an overview of searching,
      adding, editing, and deleting items, please see the <a href="cp-basics.html">Control Panel Basics</a> section of this software manual.

    <span class="header-section">Search Term Tracking</span>
    <div class="section">
      Each time a user performs a new search, the search term they use will be logged.  The term will be logged exactly as the user entered it
      in the text input box, with no processing.  If further searches are done using the same search term, the frequency for that term will be
      incremented.  This will give you a list of all search terms that were entered and allow you to see which are most popular.  You can also
      of course display these on your TubeX pages.
